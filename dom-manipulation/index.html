<!--Building a Dynamic Content Generator with Advanced DOM Manipulation
<!--mandatory
Objective: Learn to create and manipulate dynamic content in a web application using advanced DOM manipulation techniques. This task focuses on generating interactive elements directly through JavaScript without relying on frameworks.

Task Description:
Develop a web application that dynamically generates content based on user input and interactions. This project will provide hands-on experience with creating, modifying, and managing elements in the DOM, demonstrating the core capabilities of JavaScript for building interactive web pages.

Specific Project Details:
Application Overview:
Create a “Dynamic Quote Generator” that displays different quotes based on user-selected categories. Include functionality to add new quotes and categories dynamically through the user interface.
Step 1: Setup the Basic HTML Structure
HTML Setup:
Create a simple HTML file index.html with basic structure including placeholders for dynamic content.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dynamic Quote Generator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Dynamic Quote Generator</h1>
    <div id="quoteDisplay"></div>
    <button id="newQuote">Show New Quote</button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
Step 2: Implement Advanced DOM Manipulation in JavaScript
JavaScript Implementation:
Write a JavaScript file (script.js) that handles the creation and manipulation of DOM elements based on user interactions.
Manage an array of quote objects where each quote has a text and a category. Implement functions to display a random quote and to add new quotes called showRandomQuote and createAddQuoteForm` respectively
Step 3: Dynamic Quote Addition
Adding Quotes Dynamically:
Enhance the application to allow users to add their own quotes through a simple form interface. Update the DOM and the quotes array dynamically when a new quote is added.
  <div>
    <input id="newQuoteText" type="text" placeholder="Enter a new quote" />
    <input id="newQuoteCategory" type="text" placeholder="Enter quote category" />
    <button onclick="addQuote()">Add Quote</button>
  </div>

  
  Implementing Web Storage and JSON Handling
mandatory
Objective: Learn to use web storage mechanisms to store, retrieve, and manage data locally in the browser, and handle JSON data effectively within a web application.

Task Description:
Enhance the “Dynamic Quote Generator” from Task 1 by integrating local storage and session storage to persist quotes across browser sessions. Additionally, implement functionality to import and export quotes in JSON format, providing users with the ability to save and load their data.

Step 1: Integrate Web Storage
Using Local Storage:

Modify the JavaScript code to save the quotes array to local storage every time a new quote is added. Ensure that the application loads existing quotes from local storage when initialized.
Using Session Storage (Optional):

Demonstrate the use of session storage by temporarily storing user preferences or session-specific data, such as the last viewed quote.
Step 2: JSON Data Import and Export
Implement JSON Export:

Provide a button that allows users to export their quotes to a JSON file. Use Blob and URL.createObjectURL to create a download link.
Implement JSON Import:

Provide a file input to allow users to upload a JSON file containing quotes. Read the file and update the quotes array and local storage accordingly.
  <input type="file" id="importFile" accept=".json" onchange="importFromJsonFile(event)" />
  function importFromJsonFile(event) {
    const fileReader = new FileReader();
    fileReader.onload = function(event) {
      const importedQuotes = JSON.parse(event.target.result);
      quotes.push(...importedQuotes);
      saveQuotes();
      alert('Quotes imported successfully!');
    };
    fileReader.readAsText(event.target.files[0]);
  }
Step 3: Testing and Validation
Ensure Robust Functionality:
Test all new functionalities thoroughly to ensure they work as expected. Verify that quotes are correctly persisted across sessions, and that import/export functions handle data correctly.
